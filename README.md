# JS-Pomodoro

Introducing a simple [Pomodoro app](https://ferrommu.github.io/JS-Pomodoro/pomodoro.html) that helps you stay focused on your tasks! Set the time for work, rest, and long rest, and then click the "start" button to begin your work session. The app will "bip" when the time is up, so you don't have to keep checking the clock. If you prefer, you can also select the "auto" option to switch automatically from work to rest and back again, without any additional clicks. Try it out and boost your productivity today!
